# Machine Learning Classification
Pipeline for classifying samples using different machine learning algorithms, and plots for visualizing and analyzing the results.

## About the data
The __['data.csv'](https://github.com/CassSouza/Machine-Learning-Classification/tree/main/Database)__ dataframe consists of real world data that has been subjected to a clr (centered log-ratio) transformation. Labels and features have had their names changed to generic names in order to preserve the source of the data.

## Machine Learning Algorithms 
Machine learning algorithms available:

+ __[SVM](https://github.com/CassSouza/Machine-Learning-Classification/tree/main/SVM)__ 

Inside each folder, there is a .ipynb file with the complete pipeline to build a machine learning model: load the data, build the classification model, and generate the evaluation plots (confusion matrix, Precision-Recall curve, and ROC curve). The evaluation plots can be seen in the .ipynb itself or inside the 'Outputs' folder that are present inside each model folder.
